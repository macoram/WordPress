# WordPress

This repo contains a few custom plugins that I've made over the years for various companies. 

The FBCCustomPostTypes plugin adds a few different custom post types and some shortcodes to display search forms and archives.

The Jobs plugin was written to allow uploading and storage of job applications. It adds a custom post type, custom taxonomy, WP Tables extension, and various shortcodes.

The Xylem-Surveys plugin was written to allow users to fill out forms and for those forms to be reviewed by admin users and exported as PDFs. This plugin adds custom post type, custom taxonomies, custom user roles, WP tables extension, plugin settings page, shortcodes, and google translate and MPDF integration.
